This code was mainly meant for me to practice in Python. Simply running the file named GUI from your preferred IDE should create a GUI from which you can login into your GMAIL and send your emails and read them.

1. HOW TO USE
 - First run the GUI file, this should start up a GUI which you can use to send and receive emails
 - Now you need to login with your GMAIL emailadress and an app password.
   See the following link on how to get an app password for your account:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
 - You may use the login button to verify your login information, this is not needed in current versions as your login information is double checked when you use any of the functionality
 - That is all now enjoy sending your emails and reading incoming emails

2. SET UP
 - The program consists of two files, the GUI file holding the logic of how the interface is set up and the GUI functions file holding the functions that handle functionality behind the interfacet.
   The GUI file holds thus widgets which are coupled to specific functions in the GUI functions file.
